 This is an application that I coded along during a JavaScript course with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). 
 Bankist is a bank application for users that allows them to see their transactions, transfer money to other users, request loans and close their account.
This application was made to re-enforce functional programming in javascript, along with advanced DOM manipulation. [BankistBank](https://tobyrams.github.io/BankistBank/).
 ### For easy demo perposes accounts are: 
 - `User: js` `Password : 1111`
 - `User: jd` `Password : 2222`

## Features
 - **User login** - Simple login where I get the users first and last names as the 'user' and then their password.  
 - **Calculate Balance** - Calculates the users balance and them displays it back to the user in the UI.  
 - **Display Summary** - This displays the users total money in, money out, and their interest.  
 - **Display movements** - Displays the users transactions like money transfered to another account and loans granted. 
 - **Timer** - If the user is inactive for 2 minutes the application will logg the user out. 
 - **Sort movements** - This sorts the movements from depoisits to withdraws.  
 - **Transfers** - Users will be able to transfer money to another by enteering what account they would like to transfer to and the amount.  
 - **Loan** - Users are able to request a loan from the bank.
 - **Account Closure** - The user will be able to close their account and it will be terminated instantly.
